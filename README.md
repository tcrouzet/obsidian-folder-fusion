# Obsidian Folder Fusion

Add a "Folder fusion" command to your folders that compile in one file all the markdon files under the folder and sub-folders.

The "fusions-folder-date.md" is saved at the root of the folder (this file is excluded from next fusion).
You can keep it as a way to archive work in progress or you can export it with a Pandoc plugin like [Enhancing Export](https://github.com/mokeyish/obsidian-enhancing-export).

## Manual Installation
Hopefully, this plugin will make it to Obsidian's plugin gallery, until then, you can install it manually:

Download the main.js and manifest.json files from the latest release's package.
Go to the /.obsidian/plugins folder of your Obsidian vault. Create /obsidian-folder-fusion in there.
Put the downloaded files into this folder.
Restart Obsidian.
Open Obsidian's settings and find Folder Fusion among Community plugins. Enable the plugin, it's done.

PS: on MacOS, use Commande (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + Point (.) to show hidden files beginning with a point.
