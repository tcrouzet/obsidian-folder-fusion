# Obsidian Folder Fusion

Add a "Folder fusion" command to your folders that compile in one file all the markdon files under the folder and sub-folders.

The "fusions-folder-date.md" is saved at the root of the folder (this file is excluded from next fusion).
You can keep it as a way to archive work in progress or you can export it with a Pandoc plugin like [Enhancing Export](https://github.com/mokeyish/obsidian-enhancing-export).
